This project is to make a version of Quake 2 for Android that runs well as a desktop application with full mouse/keyboard play support.

I forked this project to learn about Android Applications ( I have never worked with developing for Android before ) and also because I seem to use my PC less and less these days in favour of Android but there is a lack of games that have proper mouse support.

The current status of this project is it can be sucessfully compiled and run, has working mouse support and is stable on singleplayer.

Once I fix a few of the below bugs I will create a release APK.


Current issues
------- ------
If the application is paused in any way ( minimised, resized, covered by another window ) it will freeze
The control overlay needs some rework
Clear instructions to loading paks are needed on the entry screen
A faulty Quake 2 cfg file can make the application crash at startup. The Quake 2 config file should be part managed by DeXQ2
Multiplayer crashes during play
